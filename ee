jehovah buried satan dead
do fearers worship much and quick?
badness not being felt as bad
itself thinks goodness what is meek
obey says toc, submit says tic
eternity is a five year plan
if joy and pain shall hang in hoc
who dares to call himself a man?

go dreamless knaves on shadows fed
your harry's tom, your tom is dick
while Gadgets murder, squawk and add
the cult of Same is all the chic
by instruments,both span and spic
are justly measured Spic and Span:
to kiss the mike if Jew turn kike,
who dares to call himself a man. 

loudly for truth have liars pled
their souls for freedom slaves will click
where boobs are holy, poets mad
illustrious punks of progress shriek
when Souls are outlawed, Hearts are sick
hearts being sick, minds nothing can
if Hates a game and Loves a fuck
who dares to call himself a man?

King Christ,this world is all aleak
and lifepreservers there are none
and waves wich only He can walk
who dares to call Himself a man?
